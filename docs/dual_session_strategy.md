# Dual Session Strategy

This document explains the "Dual Session" architecture implemented in the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) service to secure the Web application.

## Overview

The BFF maintains two distinct, concurrent session mechanisms. This separation balances the standard ease-of-use provided by Spring Security with the custom requirements of a distributed microservices environment.

---

## 1. Spring Security Session (`JSESSIONID`)

**Type:** Standard Servlet Session (Stateful).  
**Storage:** In-memory (can be Redis-backed).

### Purpose
The `JSESSIONID` session is used primarily for the **initial authentication flow** and **identity retrieval**.

*   **OAuth2 Orchestration:** Manages the state of the Authorization Code grant flow (redirects to Keycloak, state/nonce validation).
*   **Identity Source:** Populates the `SecurityContextHolder`. This allows the `/bff/user` endpoint to return the user's OIDC claims (name, email, roles) using standard `@AuthenticationPrincipal` injection.
*   **Scoped Access:** Limited to the BFF's internal controllers that do not proxy requests to downstream services.

---

## 2. BFF Custom Session (`BFF_SESSION`)

**Type:** Custom Opaque Token (Cookie-based JWT reference).  
**Storage:** Redis (OIDC tokens) + Browser Cookie (Signed pointer).

### Purpose
The `BFF_SESSION` is the "heavy lifter" used for **API Proxying** and **Token Lifecycle Management**.

*   **Token Abstraction:** Instead of sending the large Keycloak Access Token (JWT) to the browser, the BFF stores it in Redis and gives the browser a small, signed `BFF_SESSION` cookie containing a `jti` (unique ID).
*   **Stateless Proxying:** When a request hits `/bff/api/**`, the `TokenRefreshFilter` extracts the `jti` from the cookie, retrieves the *real* tokens from Redis, and attaches them to the outgoing request to the Gateway.
*   **Proactive Refresh:** Because the tokens are stored in Redis, the BFF can proactively refresh the Access Token using the Refresh Token *before* forwarding the request, without the browser ever knowing.

## Why use two sessions?

| Feature | JSESSIONID (Spring) | BFF_SESSION (Custom) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Login flow & Local Identity | Distributed API Access |
| **Security** | Standard CSRF/Session Mgmt | XSS mitigation (Opaque pointer) |
| **Scale** | Tied to Servlet Container | Distributed via Redis |
| **Complexity** | Low (Auto-configured) | Medium (Manual Filter/Service) |

### The Security Synergy
1.  **XSS Protection:** Even if an attacker steals the `BFF_SESSION` cookie, they do not have the raw Keycloak Access Token. They only have a signed reference.
2.  **Instant Revocation:** By deleting the entry in Redis, the session is invalidated across the entire system instantly, even if the cookie hasn't expired.
3.  **No Token Leakage:** The browser never sees the Keycloak JWT, preventing it from being leaked via logs, history, or browser extensions.

    autonumber
    participant Browser
    participant BFF as BFF Service
    participant Redis as Redis Store
    participant IDP as Keycloak

    Note over Browser, IDP: Phase 1: Login (JSESSIONID created)
    Browser->>BFF: GET /bff/login
    BFF->>IDP: Redirect to Login
    IDP-->>BFF: Auth Code
    BFF->>IDP: Exchange Code for Tokens
    IDP-->>BFF: Access + Refresh Tokens

    Note over Browser, Redis: Phase 2: Session Upgrade (BFF_SESSION created)
    BFF->>Redis: Store Tokens (Key: JTI)
    BFF-->>Browser: Set-Cookie: BFF_SESSION (Signed JTI)
    BFF-->>Browser: Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID

    Note over Browser, BFF: Phase 3: API Proxying
    Browser->>BFF: GET /bff/api/orders (Cookie: BFF_SESSION)
    BFF->>BFF: Extract JTI from Cookie
    BFF->>Redis: Load Access Token by JTI
    Redis-->>BFF: Return Access Token
    BFF->>Gateway: Forward with Authorization: Bearer
```

## Logout

When `/bff/logout` is called, the system performs a **Full Cleanup**:
1.  **Redis:** Deletes the session data associated with the `jti`.
2.  **JSESSIONID:** Invalidate the Spring HTTP session.
3.  **Cookies:** Clears both `BFF_SESSION` and `JSESSIONID` from the browser.
4.  **SSO:** Redirects to Keycloak to invalidate the global Single Sign-On session.
